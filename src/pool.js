/**
 * Creates a pool of web workers and a queue to which instructions can be added,
 * which will be executed in fi-fo by the workers. An instruction consists of a
 * message, an array of Transferable objects (empty if not needed) and a
 * callback function which is called when the instruction has finished
 * (a.k.a. the worker has posted a message back). Returns a function with which
 * a certain message can be sent to all workers and a function with which to add
 * instructions to the queue. The latter function returns a function with which
 * the instruction can be removed from the queue if you want to cancel it.
